  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the preparation of "The Exhibition Drama," the
author has endeavored to present as great a variety as in
the previous volumes of this series, and to comply, as far as
possible, with the requests of numerous correspondents.
Thus "Enlisted for the War" was written in response to a
demand for something, based on the late civil war, which
should meet the requirements of various Posts of the G. A. R.
The musical allegories, "The Visions of Freedom," and
"The Tournament of Idylcourt," were prepared for the
graduating-class in a Boston grammar-school, and are of the
same general character as those previously issued. The
Christmas entertainment, and the dramatization of Dickens's
"Christmas Carol," have both been successfully performed
at sabbath-school entertainments. These, as well as
the allegories, are plentifully supplied with tableaux, easily
represented, and are adapted to the wants of many occasional
exhibitions.</p>

<p class='c000'>That "Amateur Dramas" are successful, the appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of a fifth volume is convincing testimony. In addition to
this, the warm commendations of the press, frequent testimonials
from public teachers, and last, though not least, a
steadily increasing demand for the old as well as the new,
convince the author that he is honorably catering to a
healthy appetite for innocent and wholesome recreation.</p>

<p class='c011'>NOTE.—"<span class='sc'>Enlisted for the War</span>," here presented in its

Where a military display is desirable, the second act will allow of
"an awkward-squad drill," "relieving guard," a bayonet-drill,
or the introduction of a camp song. At the end of the third act,
the returning company might march across the stage, behind
windows and door, illuminated with white and red lights, with
the chorus "Marching through Georgia."</p>

    this going, going at such a ruinous sacrifice; and I'm only offered nine hundred and
    fifty dollars for it; literally flowing with milk and honey. Shall I have ten,—ten, do
    you say? Quick, or you lose it; nine hundred and fifty once, nine hundred and fifty

    <dt><em>Mrs. T.</em></dt>
    <dd>It's a shame to let it go for that price, and to a stranger.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mattie.</em></dt>
    <dd>Mr. Rowell is no stranger, mother. It's now five years since he came to Grainlow with Mr.

    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mrs. T.</em></dt>
    <dd>For all that, he's a stranger,—a proud, <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>haughty man, whom nobody likes, nobody
    has confidence in.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mattie.</em></dt>
    <dd>Mr. Gifford had confidence enough to give him the guardianship of his daughter when he
    died two years ago; and Gaylie likes him. As for being proud and haughty, to me he is
    always pleasant and condescending.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mrs. T.</em></dt>
    <dd>Condescending, indeed! You're just as good as he is. Bless you, child, the Trueworths
    held their heads as high as the best of folks until our troubles commenced. Your father
    took to borrowing to experiment with his patent wrinkles, and mortgaged the farm to that
    mean skinflint, Hosea Jenks. Ah, well! he did it for the best, no doubt. Only six months
    dead, and now the old farm has gone too.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mattie.</em></dt>
    <dd>Mother 'tis hard, 'tis cruel, to leave you homeless in your old age. Had father been wise—
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mrs. T.</em></dt>
    <dd>Hush, child! not a word against him. He was a good, kind father, and a husband to be
    proud of. In all his troubles he never would touch a cent of the money we had put by to
    push Rob through college. That was safely locked up; and the lad came through with all
    the honors.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mattie.</em></dt>
    <dd>What good can his learning do him now?
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mrs. T.</em></dt>
    <dd>That remains to be seen. When the call came for men, our boy, bless him! stepped out with
    the first, and enlisted for the war. Then came the hard blow, hardest of all to bear. My
    own dear, noble husband breathed out his life in my arms, and joined the true and noble
    in that better land. Hark! I hear Robert's step. (<span class='sc'>Mattie</span>

    <dd>(<em>embracing her</em>). O mother! this should not have been. Had I known the worst, I
    could have prevented it. I have strong arms and a cool head. I could have managed the
    farm. I thought father was so comfortably settled; and now my enlistment binds me. Oh, I
    could have done bravely!
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mrs. T.</em></dt>
    <dd>(<em>recovering</em>). And you will do bravely now, where every true man should stand in
    the hour of his country's peril, in the ranks of brave defenders. Fear not for us:
    there's a power of strength in these old arms yet, and a stout heart to struggle; ay, and
    a brave one. Am I not the mother of a man who leaves all to serve his country?
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rob.</em></dt>
    <dd>Brave mother, you shall have a son to be proud of.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mrs. T.</em></dt>
    <dd>Right, boy. And my prayers and blessing shall cheer you on to victory.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rob.</em></dt>
    <dd>Yet you are homeless, mother. Our regiment is ready for the field: it only awaits the
    appointment of a colonel. I may be called away at an hour's notice. If I could only have

    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rob.</em></dt>
    <dd>Yes, her old home. Dear little girl! how fond we all were of her, and she of us! But she
    went away to school two years ago, perhaps has forgotten us.

    <dd>Yes, I know; and yet I could not <em>ask</em> her assistance.

    <dt><em>Mattie.</em></dt>
    <dd>Perhaps you are right, Rob; but it does seem hard, after all the care and attention she

    <dt><em>Rob.</em></dt>

    beautiful, without becoming more and <span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>more strongly attached to her. At college
    my dreams were of her; my waking thoughts again and again fashioned her image into dear

    win her.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mrs. T.</em></dt>
    <dd>Rob, my boy, 'tis a wild dream. She is a rich heiress; in a year will be mistress of that

    <dd>Yes, mother; but I am a soldier of the Union; and, out of that glorious majority who are

    <dd>Well, I certainly have heard something to my advantage. So, my fine soldier-boy, you love
    my ward, Gaylie Gifford. So do I. There we are perfectly agreed. But, when it comes to
    possession, I think we shall quarrel. Forewarned, forearmed. I have purchased this farm
    for the purpose of pleasing my ward; well knowing, that, had she been informed of the
    sale, she would have requested its purchase, that in gratitude she might have restored it
    to her old protectress. Her gratitude to me, for my wise forethought, would, no doubt,
    bring me one step nearer to my ambition. But this soldier loves her; should she be
    allowed to carry out her wishes, would love her all the more, perhaps arouse an answering
    affection. No. I'll keep the farm for my own pleasure; perhaps play the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span></i>
    of benefactor myself. Gaylie's large fortune must be shared with me. I never dreamed of
    this fellow's ambition. He rise? If fortune only smile upon me, I will guard against that.

    short jacket, and shorter pantaloons. Makes me keep my hair sandpapered like an urchin of
    ten. It's about time this thing was stopped. If my arm creeps through this jacket much
    farther, I'm very much afraid it will rise in indignation, and smite my aged sire. "Honor
    your parents" is a very good maxim, but it may be carried a little too far. I'd go into
    the army, but he won't let me; swears I <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>shall stand by the old flag. (<em>Clasps
    the auction-flag in his arms.</em>) No matter: it's only a year, and I am free. Ah!
    here's Mattie Trueworth, a girl I would lay down my life for, and who laughs at me.
    Heigho! if I wasn't a boy, I should be very much in love with her. How d'ye do, Mattie?

    <dd>You do this, Mr. Rowell: you give me the farm freely, unconditionally?

    <dt><em>Rowell.</em></dt>
    <dd>Not exactly. There is one condition, and only one. (<span class='sc'>Mattie</span>

    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rob.</em></dt>
    <dd>One condition. Mr. Rowell, before you state that condition, let us understand one
    another. I do not like you. I have felt an instinctive dislike from the time you first
    entered this town. I have heard hard stories concerning you,—that you have wronged men,
    ay, and women too. With all that, I have no right to prevent my mother and sister from
    remaining in their old home. I will not, can I do so honorably. But I will accept no
    favor from you. Show me any way in which I can redeem this place, the way to win it back
    by good service that shall repay in full all expenses you have incurred in its purchase,
    or encumber it with a mortgage and heavy interest; but give me time to redeem, and I will
    believe you are my friend, will trust you. Come, I have spoken plainly: now let me hear
    your condition.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rowell.</em></dt>
    <dd>Ha! I like plain speaking. You are an adept at it. You don't like me. Well, then, in
    place of favor, I will offer a bargain. Here it is: this farm <span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>to you and yours
    forever, for a promise—a pledge—that you never offer your hand to my ward, Gaylie Gifford.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rob.</em></dt>
    <dd>Gaylie Gifford,—my hand!—Mr. Rowell, you are jesting.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rowell.</em></dt>
    <dd>No, I am serious. When I entered this house for the first time to-day, I heard your
    confession to your mother. I know how grateful Gaylie is for the kind care bestowed upon
    her here in childhood; and I would not have her kind heart wounded by the belief that one
    with whom she has been so intimate should presume upon her friendship, to seek to gain
    her hand, and with it a fortune.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rob</em></dt>
    <dd>(<em>rising</em>). Mr. Rowell, you are insulting.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rowell.</em></dt>
    <dd>Come, be reasonable! You can never hope to win her. Give me your promise, and the farm is
    yours.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rob.</em></dt>
    <dd>No! A thousand times no! You know my secret, but you know not me. I do love Gaylie
    Gifford, and with a hopeless love. The very fortune you taunt me with seeking is a bar to
    keep me silent.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rowell.</em></dt>
    <dd>Then take the farm. I will willingly give it up to purchase your silence. She can never
    be yours: 'twas her father's wish, that, when she became of age, her hand should be given
    to another.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rob.</em></dt>
    <dd>And that other, yourself. Am I not right, Wilder Rowell?
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rowell.</em></dt>
    <dd>'Twas a pretty shrewd guess.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rob.</em></dt>
    <dd>It is a lie. He had no such wish. My father was with him when he died.

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span></div>
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rob.</em></dt>
    <dd>Ay, a lie! You like plain speaking. I know he left her free to choose her own mate, and
    bade you, as her guardian, to respect her choice.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rowell.</em></dt>
    <dd>I am her choice. Already she trusts me, with a confidence that only love can bring; and
    I, I love her, dearer than all else in the world.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rob.</em></dt>
    <dd>Except her fortune. You love her, Wilder Rowell, and she is in your power. Poor Gaylie!
    You shall not win her. She is too good, too pure, to mate with such as you, an
    adventurer, a fortune-hunter.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rowell.</em></dt>
    <dd>Indeed! Come, we are rivals. I will be magnanimous: you shall have the first chance.
    Speak, tell her of your love. If she says, Yes, I'm silent.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rob.</em></dt>
    <dd>O villain! you know your power. Speak to her, tell her of my love; I a poor soldier, she
    a rich heiress! She would think me as mercenary as I know you to be. No, no, I cannot: I
    love her dearly, truly, but must still love on in secret. (<em>Falls into chair, and
    buries his face in his hands on table</em>).
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rowell</em></dt>
    <dd>(<em>rising. Aside</em>). Honorable to the last! There's no fear of him.
    (<em>Aloud.</em>) Think well of it, Trueworth. Take the farm, and make your dear ones
    comfortable. The prize you covet hangs too high. (<em>Aside.</em>) Silent! I'll look in
    on him again (<em>takes deed</em>): an hour's reflection may awaken a better spirit.

    <dd>Sold! Why have I heard nothing of this?

    <dd>Your guardian, Wilder Rowell.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Gaylie.</em></dt>

    <dd>O Innocence! thy name is Wilder Rowell. But I know your secret. You have bought this farm.

    <dt><em>Rowell.</em></dt>
    <dd>Yes: a good piece of property, they say.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Gaylie.</em></dt>

    consideration. So it's my property?
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rowell.</em></dt>
    <dd>No, it's my property. Not as your agent, but for myself, I bought this farm. I mean to
    settle down, and become a sober, plodding farmer, and, in time, take to myself a wife.

    <dd>Guardy, I <em>have</em> been mistaken. But you will sell <em>me</em> the farm. Come, you

    this farm.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rowell.</em></dt>

    <dt><em>Gaylie.</em></dt>

    <dd>Yes, Gaylie: on terms no honest man could for a moment consider.

    <dt><em>Rowell.</em></dt>

    ownership.

    <dt><em>Rob</em></dt>
    <dd>(<em>comes down</em>). A common soldier! True. I glory in my rank. You leap to a command
    by power and influence. My spurs must yet be won. I am content. Should I rise by merit,
    no emblems of rank could shed a brighter glow than gleams from the trusty bayonets of

    <dd>Ay, indeed, Col. Rowell. You are my guardian, true; but you forget my father's will. In

    distort your power. I will be mistress of my fortune. I will be free to bestow my hand.
    With the one, I will protect the homeless; with the other, cheer him at whom you

    </dd>
    <dt><em>Gaylie.</em></dt>
    <dd>You command? You forget I am a leader here. I entreat you, in the name of justice, to
    deal fairly and honorably by this true hero, who leaves all to serve his country, to
    recognize his right to the hand which I freely give. Come, sir, do we part friends?
    </dd>

    </dd>
    <dt><em>Gaylie.</em></dt>
    <dd>Then beware! you make yourself my enemy. Already you disgrace the rank you've bought, not
    won. You have command, and my hero in your power. I have love, wealth, and a loyal heart,
    that abhors injustice. Against all treachery and deceit, against the wily arts you may
    contrive to shame my hero, I am the Home-Guard, the firm friend, enlisted for the war.

    <dd>The boys are making merry to-night around the camp-fire; but that lively air brings only
    sadness to me. "The girl I left behind me," two years ago, in Grainlow, Gaylie Gifford,
    is still silent. Not a line in reply to my frequent letters. Has she repented of her
    choice? No, I cannot believe that; for my sister writes me she often speaks of me, longs
    for my return. But yet she never writes. Perhaps she has never received mine; 'tis hardly
    possible, and yet her silence—Can my enemy, the colonel, be conspiring to keep us apart?
    He is base enough to use any means to serve <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>his purpose. By his orders, the mail
    is brought here, and inspected by him, before delivery; perhaps, that he may intercept
    any letters for me. If I could only get a single line from her, I would be content. Oh! I
    am ground down worse than any slave that tills the earth beneath the overseer's lash. Two
    years of service, and still a private! I know I have been honorably mentioned many times
    by my captain; and yet poorer men step above me: and I toil on, fight on, with no hope of
    promotion. Well, they shall not say I have not done my duty. Will the end never come, and
    free me from this bondage, give me liberty to turn my steps northward, to seek the star

    <dt><em>Mrs. T.</em></dt>
    <dd>They parted as lovers: but you know two years ago Wilder Rowell resigned his command, and
    returned to Grainlow; that from that time he has been a constant visitor to this house;
    that he is always welcomed by its mistress; that he attends her in all her walks and
    drives; that she smiles upon him, and <span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>evidently delights in his company. You

    <dt><em>Mrs. T.</em></dt>
    <dd>Doubt her affection for us? No! Has she not been a dear daughter to me for these years?
    Has she not made us members of her own household? Have I not had, every day, convincing
    proofs of her affection? No, no! bless her dear heart, for Mother Trueworth has a warm
    corner in it. It's only for the boy I fear. Suppose he should come home, and find our
    Gaylie's heart turned from him, caught by this man whom I don't like, never did like, and
    never will like. There goes another stitch!
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mattie.</em></dt>

    <dt><em>Mattie.</em></dt>
    <dd>There's another jealous one! He thinks Mr. Rowell is in love with me, or pretends he
    does, and continually quarrels with me about him. But we always make up, and I really
    believe that it's for the pleasure of being reconciled every day that he does it.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mrs. T.</em></dt>
    <dd>Ah! Hiram Jenks is a good, honest, smart, reliable young man: so you be careful, and not
    quarrel too often. There may be a time when there will be no reconciliation.

    <dd>And so the war is over, and the boys are marching home, and with them comes, of course,
    Mr. Rob Trueworth. Hang the luck! I fear that fellow's appearance. Two years ago I
    resigned my command in the army for two reasons. First, an unfortunate
    <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</span></i> with Trueworth, whom I kept in the ranks after he had been several
    times honorably mentioned, awakened the suspicions of Grant, and a court-martial was
    threatened; second, a very pressing invitation from Gaylie to return, the pretext being
    business which required my assistance, but the real motive, an evident desire for my
    society. Of the first reason, I took good care to let her know nothing; and having the
    postmaster, Hosea Jenks, well under my thumb, I am sure she <span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>has received no hint
    from Trueworth. She has evidently repented of her folly, and takes kindly to my presence.
    Never a word about Rob Trueworth. Yet I seem no nearer the attainment of my heart's
    desire, than when I returned. I have assiduously courted her: we walk, ride, and sail
    together. I am attentive, devoted, and she enjoys every thing. But, when I speak of love,
    she evades it, or talks of her freedom, or we are interrupted. I will speak plainly: she
    must be bound to me ere he returns, or I fear my two-years' campaign will be wasted. Ah!
    here she is. (<em>Enter</em> <span class='sc'>Gaylie</span>, <span class='fss'>L.</span>)

    the October gale in the lofty branches of mountain hemlocks, Araminta Augusta Violetta
    sprang to her feet, and, dashing the embroidery-frame to the floor with a crash that
    shook the ancient edifice, gave one terrific, yet ecstatic scream <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>of joy, and

    <dd>Nonsense! Once for all, Mr. John Bounce, I will never marry a man who aspirates in such a
    shocking manner as you do. No, sir. The man whose <span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>bride I shall become must be
    capable of declaring his love in grammatical, pronounceably correct English. He must fall
    gracefully upon his knees before me, and, in accents too wild to be resisted, say,
    "Patty, my heart"—not <em>art</em>, Mr. Bounce; I'll have no artful man—"is at your
    feet." Not <em>hat</em>. Hats are for heads, not feet, Mr. Bounce. When you can do that,
    speak: till then a gulf as wide as that which once yawned between Felix Frederick

    <dt><em>Mr. G.</em></dt>
    <dd>Yes, I do. Watkins tells me he has a wonderful preparation, one application of which will
    instantly turn white, gray, red, or yellow hair to a beautiful black. Think of it,

    <dt><em>Mr. G.</em></dt>
    <dd>Certainty, my dear. I have three reasons: the first of which is, she is too young to
    marry.
    </dd>

    <dd><em>Mrs. G. and Alice</em> (<em>together</em>). Too young to marry!

    young to marry.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mrs. G.</em></dt>
    <dd>Nonsense! She's as old as I am. If that is your opinion, why did you allow me to marry?
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mr. G.</em></dt>
    <dd>(<em>aside</em>). Stuck my foot in it. (<em>Aloud.</em>) You didn't allow me to finish.
    Too young to marry a young man.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Alice.</em></dt>
    <dd>Indeed! Well, I'll never marry an old one, <span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>if I live to be as old as my
    grandmother. I do detest old men, and middle-aged men too.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mr. G.</em></dt>
    <dd>(<em>aside</em>). Stuck my foot in it again.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mrs. G.</em></dt>
    <dd>So much for your first reason. What is your second?
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mr. G.</em></dt>
    <dd>My second is, Alice can do better than to marry at all. Look at that head. How
    beautifully the reasoning bumps are developed! A phrenologist would go wild with ecstasy
    with his hands upon that head.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Alice.</em></dt>
    <dd>Would he? He'd get them well scratched for his assurance.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Mr. G.</em></dt>
    <dd>(<em>Rising, placing plate on table, and speaking with bombastic enthusiasm.</em>) Alice,
    'tis the era of progress. Woman's rights will soon be fully recognized, and woman take
    her place among the gifted and the learned. They will be called to the bar, the pulpit.
    Think of that time, and prepare to take your place,—to rule, and not be ruled. Married
    life for you! Preposterous! 'Twould be a galling chain 'gainst which your noble intellect
    would chafe and worry.

    <dt><em>Mrs. G.</em></dt>
    <dd>Certainly; to the third and last reason. What is that?

    <dt><em>Mr. G.</em></dt>

    <dt><em>Mr. G.</em></dt>

    marriage I, her lawful guardian, must pay into her hands the sum of ten thousand dollars,
    left in my hands by my deceased brother, her father, to be so paid on the occurrence of

    Well! if Hannah Merria's heouse ain't a-going to eternal smash, it's not for want er

    (kee),—not of his death, but the money,—a-prancin' round in perlitical circuses, ravin'
    like a lunatic about "speers," and "rights," and "sufferings," and leaving her home to

    <dt><em>Mrs. H.</em></dt>
    <dd>Champion fiddlesticks! There's no sense in such carryings-on. What would my old man,
    Hezekiah Hartshorn (kee)—bless his dear dead and gone memory—have thought if I'd 'a' gone
    off in this fashion, a meddlin' with things that women don't know nothin' about? When he
    took me for better or for wus, sez he to me, "Deborah, there's the old homestid,—a snug
    house and a likely farm,—all ours. Yeou <span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>take kere of the house, and I'll take
    kere of the farm. Outside I'll be master, inside you shall be mistress; and we won't
    interfere." That's all the bargain we ever made, and we stuck to it. I took good care to
    make his home pleasant; but meddlin' with his affairs would have ben as rediculous as it
    would have ben for him to stick his nose into the churn every time I made butter. No,
    indeed! Let woman do her own work, and leave man to his'n.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Caroline.</em></dt>
    <dd>Ah, grandmother, the world has turned over a great many times since your day. Women have
    acquired larger ideas of usefulness, and have found in intellectual pursuits release from
    household drudgery. Triumphs in medical practice, and success in the pulpit, have fired
    them with ambition to take their place beside the sterner sex in those educational,
    scientific, and political spheres, for which they feel themselves equally well fitted.

    <dt><em>Mrs. H.</em></dt>
    <dd>Noble cat's foot! If she wants to elervate her sex, as she calls it, let her stay to
    home, and look after things. If that Katie don't want elervating with a broomstick, then
    I'm mistaken (kee). Why don't she give you a eddication, instead of keeping you drudging
    about the house, when you should be at school with Florence? She's got your father's
    money, and that's all she keres for (kee).

    <dt><em>Florence</em></dt>
    <dd>(<em>reads</em>). "Mrs. Duplex, widow of the celebrated match-manufacturer, whose decease
    last winter was chronicled in our paper, arose and spoke warmly of the oppression of the
    female sex. She vehemently asserted their ability to achieve success in any path trodden
    by man, and eloquently styled herself the champion of her sex in its endeavors to throw
    off the yoke of bondage, and victoriously array itself by the side of man in his onward
    march of progress." What nonsense!
<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span></div>

    <dt><em>Caroline.</em></dt>
    <dd>Nonsense, Florence? Then you are not in sympathy with the woman movement.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Florence.</em></dt>
    <dd>Yes, Carrie: I am an earnest advocate for reform. Noble women are doing brave work in
    <em>educating</em> our sex to a realizing sense of their power for good in many of the
    walks of life heretofore kept sacred to the foot of man. But foolish women, who raise the
    cry of oppression or slavery, are no better than the political demagogues of the other
    sex,—loud in speech, but dumb in council.

    <dd>And so you think mother has made a mistake?

    <dt><em>Florence.</em></dt>

    since I came home, I am convinced reform is needed here. (<em>Bell rings</em>, <span

    <dd>I read a brief notice of it.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rhoda.</em></dt>
    <dd>I heard it all. She's the champion of her sex. Oh, it was grand! She flourished her right
    hand as majestically as any orator I ever heard; and her voice was as strong and clear as
    Patrick Henry's.

    <dd>Not of her last effort, Rhoda.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Pollie.</em></dt>
    <dd>That's where you're right, Floy. I wouldn't like to have my mother spouting in that
    manner. It looks coarse and unladylike.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Rhoda.</em></dt>
    <dd>Well, I don't think I should like to have my mother take to that kind of business.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Florence.</em></dt>
    <dd>I like it so little, girls, that I am determined to give mother a lesson, if you will
    grant me your assistance. Our principal, Miss Steady, had an attack of "woman's rights"
    at school last winter; and the girls took advantage of it to indulge in a little
    masquerading, which so affected our honored head, that we heard no more of woman's rights
    for the balance of the term. I shouldn't wonder if something of the kind would make
    mother a little less zealous in the cause.

    <dd>(Kee.) That you've backslid, Hannah Merria.

    <dt><em>Florence.</em></dt>
    <dd>If they are honest and earnest, they will say that she who to the welfare of her family

    they who bend beneath her loving sway, freely acknowledge her, in that grand sphere, the
    Champion of her Sex.

    <dd>Spirits of Dreamland, once again we meet,<br />Our round of nightly revel to repeat.<br
    />O'er earth, when locked in sleep's warm, close embrace,<br />Since time began, the
    genius of our race<br />Has had the power fearlessly to sway<br />The visionary sceptre
    all obey.<br />The mighty monarch, who, with tyrant frown,<br />Upholds the burden of his
    weighty crown;<br />The fierce-browed warrior who relentless slays,<br />And, bathed in
    blood, his vows to Moloch pays;<br />Haughty and lowly, powerful and weak,—<br />Under
    mysterious spells our guidance seek.<br />Sweet sister spirits, Dreamland opens wide;<br
    />Yet justice guards it well on every side.<br />Over the pure we rosy visions throw:<br
    />Around the base a sea of troubles flow.<br />Ere forth you glide to ply your happy
    arts,<br />Your queen would learn the secrets of your hearts;<br />Who hie to sport, with
    mischievous intent,<br />And who on graver ministries are bent.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Sootha.</em></dt>
    <dd>I've an old miser under watchful care,<br />With sordid soul, of generous impulse
    bare;<br />Who nightly feasts, with avaricious eyes,<br />Where treasured gold in rare
    profusion lies;<br />Who revels o'er his fast-increasing store,<br />Chuckles with glee,
    yet wistful sighs for more;<br /><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Starvation's image, in a den so bare,<br />It
    seems a fit abode for dark despair.<br />Into his sleep I glide, disturb his rest,<br
    />Rattle his treasure, till, with fear possessed,<br />As frightful visions thick and
    thicker press,<br />He trembling wakes, his idol to caress.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Oblivia.</em></dt>
    <dd>Fair queen, a toiling student I enchain,<br />And with my art refresh his weary brain:<br
    />Up wisdom's heights I lead him by the hand,<br />And show him visions of the promised
    land;<br />Fair fields of learning spread before his gaze,<br />For him the realm of
    science set ablaze,<br />Ope Fame's grand temple, Honor's scroll unroll,<br />And tell
    the triumphs of the trusting soul,<br />Till hope re-animates the wasting fire<br />With
    earnest zeal and conquering desire.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Somna.</em></dt>
    <dd>I guard a trusting maiden, young and fair,<br />Whom Love has tangled in his silken
    snare;<br />Spread rosy dreams amid her sleeping hours,<br />And lead her captive through
    a land of flowers;<br />Adorn her hero with true manly pride,<br />And of the future ope
    the portal wide,<br />While smiles of pleasure o'er her sweet face creep,<br />And
    blissful words betray her secret deep.<br />With rare delight her day-dreams I repeat,<br
    />And make her young life's round of love complete.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Drowsa.</em></dt>
    <dd>Oh, I've a task, fair queen, will love secure.<br />Last night I visited with visions
    pure<br />A weary mother, who, for many a day,<br />Watched o'er the cradle where her
    dear babe lay<br /><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Wasting with fever, till the unseen Hand<br />Took it in
    kindness to a better land.<br />Long has she mourned its loss, with wakeful eyes,<br
    />Fast-falling tears, low, sad, and bitter cries.<br />Last night she slept; and then, in
    vision's charms,<br />I crept, and laid her babe within her arms.<br />Content she
    rested, with a smile so sweet,<br />I go to-night this comfort to repeat.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Q. Mab.</em></dt>

    <dd>Thanks, sisters! To our confidence draw near,<br />And list our secret with attentive
    ear.<br />Freedom's fair goddess, Gloria, in doubt,<br />Her fair Republic, restless
    roams about,<br />Seeking a talisman to life prolong,<br />And make her youthful charge
    wax brave and strong.<br />Close at her side Rubina, crafty maid,<br />Whose fire-lit
    eyes gloat over war's dread trade,<br />Plies her bold speech, unchecked by fear of
    frown,<br />Counselling deeds of conquest and renown;<br />While calm Serena, long to
    Peace allied,<br />Whose gentle influence stretches far and wide,<br />Recounts the
    glories of a land at rest,<br />With sterling Industry's rich harvests blest.<br
    /><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Wavering betwixt the gentle and the bold,<br />By turns rebellious, and by turns
    controlled,<br />Poor Gloria wanders long, in dire distress<br />Which counsellor to
    choose her realm to bless.<br />Old custom gives to us prophetic power<br />To guide by
    vision in the trying hour.<br />And so to-night, o'er Gloria's doubting heart,<br />Fair
    sister spirits, we will ply our art,<br />Lure her to Dreamland, and in phantom light<br
    />Illume her path, and guide her to the right.<br />Stand close! she comes! the light
    winds bear along<br />The martial burden of her triumph song.

<p>REAR VIEW OF COPPER TOE SHOE HOUSE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span><span class='sc'>Note.</span>—This entertainment was prepared for a Sunday
school's Christmas Eve, and was arranged as follows: A stage,
fourteen feet square, was fitted with a "roll-up" curtain in front.
Drapery was hung at the sides and back; a Christmas tree,
filled with presents, was placed well back on the stage, and
hidden by curtains arranged to separate in the middle. In front
of these was placed "Copper Toe Shoe House." The rear view
represents the frame made of wood, in two pieces, to separate in
the middle, of the following dimensions: ten feet from toe to
heel, five feet and one half from heel to top, four feet and one
half across top, heel about twenty inches long, eight inches high.
Cover front, in two separate sections, with black cambric; for
toe, copper tinsel paper; for sole and patch, brown cambric;
for buckle, silver tinsel paper; the patch fastened only at bottom.
A curtain, of same material or color as back stage, should
be hung in rear of shank, that children standing behind may not
be seen. A settee is placed behind it, on which the children in
the dwelling stand. 1, 2, and 3 lie upon the stage, and stick
their heads out when required. The characters can pass between
the curtains at back, to their places. When the tree is disclosed,
all the characters are in front, the settee is removed, the braces
unfastened, and, at a signal, two boys run off the shoe, and
others draw the curtains.</p>

    <dd>Kneel not to me; I come to win thy heart.<br />The suitor here should choose the lowly
    part.<br />Fair mortal, listen. Genia is my name:<br />Art's chosen goddess, mighty is my
    fame.<br />Thou art the offspring of that sovereign Thought,<br />Under whose sway the
    universe is brought;<br />And I, the guiding genius of mankind,<br />In bonds submissive,
    Nature's realms to bind.<br />Before my birth, the world was filled with strife,<br />And
    all the squalor of barbaric life;<br />The human race in ignorance sunk deep,<br
    />Content to live and die in sloth and sleep.<br />But, with my coming, energy awoke,<br
    />And reason through the deadening chaos broke;<br />Awakened Thought, in wonder, sought
    by lore<br />Creation's mystic riddle to explore;<br />And, as she strove, the world's
    great change was wrought,<br />With purer joys from deeper delvings brought.<br />Beneath
    my sway, all's wonderful and grand<br />Where taste and culture deck what Nature
    planned.<br />Give me thy heart, and with all-conquering might<br />I'll guide thy steps
    through life to realms of light.<br />I bring three sisters in my regal train,<br />Who
    high in Art's supreme dominion reign.—<br />Blenda, approach. Thy skill to Poesie
    show,<br />And let rare colors on thy canvas glow.

    endure.<br />But what a triumph waits the earnest heart,<br />Who on the canvas sees her
    trophies start<br />To life and action, adding, age on age,<br />To history many a
    bright, illumined page!<br />Portraying vice with rarely gifted hand,<br />She sees a
    warning light 'gainst passion stand.<br />Depicting virtue in her pure attire,<br />She
    warms all hearts to worship and aspire.<br />Inwrapping sense and soul with pleasure
    high,<br />To homage leads the world's applauding cry.<br />Look on the picture I will
    now display,—<br />Religion standing in the heavenly way,<br />Her finger pointing in the
    Book of truth,<br />Instruction pouring in the ears of youth.

    <dd>O girls! I have found it out at last. Only think of it! a romance in Rosebush Institute!

    <dd>Well, not exactly a prince; but Hopps the milkman told me that Johnson the butcher told
    him that Bates the expressman told him that Patience Plunkett belongs in Razorly, and
    that his agent there told him that Job Seedling was the son of a rich farmer; that he got
    desperately enamoured of Patience, and followed her here, taking a menial situation that
    he might be near the object of his love. Isn't it splendid?
    </dd>

    <dt><em>Tom.</em></dt>
    <dd>Because Tom is only homesick, girls. My good aunt would not give me time to explain that
    I was tired of school, eager to have a frolic, and so got leave of absence, and came home
    for a day. No: she caught the "sickness," and bundled me off to bed. I humored the joke,
    and laughed under the bedquilt. But no sooner was she out of the room, but I was out of
    bed, dressed myself, and here I am, ready for any thing in the way of sport you have to
    offer. How long will she be gone?

large white comforter about his neck.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Tiny Tim.</span> Roundabout jacket; comforter about his neck; crutch;
cap.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span><span class='sc'>Boy.</span> Jacket; large cap; very red nose; large mittens; comforter
about his neck.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Christmas Past.</span> A little girl; short white spangled dress; white
stockings; shoes; a wig of long white hair.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Christmas Present.</span> Purple robe reaching to the floor, trimmed
with fur; long, brown, curly hair; full brown beard; on his
head "a holly-wreath, set here and there with shining icicles;"
a belt around his waist, to which is attached a scabbard.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Christmas to Come.</span> Long black robe, with hood entirely concealing
his features.</p>

<p class='c010'>These costumes can be altered or improved by reference to
Fields, Osgood, &amp; Co.'s illustrated Christmas Carol.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Arrangement.</span> This entertainment is arranged for a stage eighteen
feet wide by fourteen feet deep. A curtain, to draw up,
is required between the audience and the performers. Half
way up the stage, another curtain, to separate in the centre,
and draw aside; the front curtain should be green, the back
dark fabric. The front of the stage represents Scrooge's office,
where the dream (in this version) occurs. The back is used for
the pictures. For home representation, the same arrangement
can be easily carried out. The performer is directed as though
standing upon the stage, facing audience.</p>

    <dd>I do. Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas-time to <em>you</em> but a time for
    paying bills without money,—a time for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour
    richer? Bah! If I had my will, every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas" on his
    lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and burned with a stake of holly through his
    heart, he should.

    <dd>There are many good things, from which I might have derived good, by which I have not
    profited, I dare say Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of
    Christmas-time when it has come round, apart from the veneration due to its sacred origin
    (if any thing belonging to it can be apart from that), as a good time,—a kind, forgiving,
    charitable, pleasant time,—the only time I know of in the long calendar of the year when
    men and women seem, by one consent, to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of
    people below them as if they really were fellow-travellers to the grave, and not another
    race of creatures, bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put
    a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and
    <em>will</em> do me good; and I say, God bless it! (<span class='sc'>Bob</span> <em>claps

    <dt><em>Marley.</em></dt>

    <dt><em>Scrooge.</em></dt>
    <dd>Because a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats.
    You may be an undigested blot of beef, a bit of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of
    an underdone potato. There's more of gravy than grave about you, whatever you are. (<span

    <dd>It is required of every man, that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his

    <dt><em>Marley.</em></dt>
    <dd>Oh, blind man! blind man! not to know that ages of incessant labor by immortal creatures
    for this earth, must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all
    developed; not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life's
    opportunities misused. Yet I was like this man. I once was like this man.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Scrooge.</em></dt>
    <dd>But you were always a good man of business, Jacob.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Marley.</em></dt>
    <dd>Business! Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business. Charity, mercy,
    forbearance, benevolence, were all my business. Hear me; my time is nearly gone.

    <dt><em>Scrooge.</em></dt>

    </dd>
    <dt><em>Marley.</em></dt>
    <dd>Without their visits you cannot hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first to-night,
    when the bell tolls one. Expect the second to-morrow night at the same hour; the third
    upon the next night, when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me
    no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
